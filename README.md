# GUIDE FOR DOCUMENTING TEST REPORTS

**Options for creating structured reports:**

- Through google docs, or
- Through markdown files (provide link of your own github repository where you hosted it)

**If Markdown Files:**

For strict standards, I recommend creating folders first for each functionality for categorization. Then, inside those folders, create a markdown file, and give it a meaningful name. I suggest naming these markdown files as the date of when you wrote the test.

For example:

```
root-folder/ 		             => the top-level folder directory
   |— auth/ 		             => should only contain all reports related to Auth feature
   |     |— august-1-2025.md     => all test reports for AUTH feature tested on August 1, 2025
   |     |— august-2-2025.md     => all test reports for AUTH feature tested on August 2, 2025
   |
   |— flashcards/ 			     => should only contain all reports related to Flashcards feature
   |     |— august-1-2025.md     => all test reports for FLASHCARD feature tested on August 1
   |     |— august-2-2025.md     => all test reports for FLASHCARD feature tested on August 2

```

## Format for writing a report’s content (this format is the standard whether you opt to write reports on docs, or on markdown file) - DEPRECATED

- CODE NUMBER (insert a heading pls)
- DESCRIPTION
- STATUS - (pass or fail?)
- NETWORK TAB RESULTS (can be found at the inspect browser DOM)
- ERROR ENCOUNTERED (You can find hints on console logs or network tabs at inspect browser)
- FEEDBACK/SUGGESTIONS

## TESTING DOCUMENTATION RULES (Updated - Sept 13, 2025)

- All test case references are stored in `catalog.md` with unique IDs:
  - Axxx -> Auth module
  - FLxxx -> Flashcards module
  - FOxxx -> Forums module
  - Nxxx -> Notes module
  - PTxxx -> Pomodoro Timer module
  - PFxxx -> Profile module
  - Qxxx -> Quizzes module
  - STxxx -> Settings module
  - NAVxxx -> System Navigations (New)
- Each catalog's feature logs follow this format:

  - **FEAT_CODE: Feature name**
    > Brief feature description

- Test iterations remain on each file with its corresponding date (ex. `sept-3-2025.md`). However, it will now have this new format:

```
ALL TESTS FOR [Feature] ON [Date]

TLDR:
- 🚧 lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- ✅ lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- ❌ lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

---

# What was tested
- **FEAT_xx: [Feature name]**
  - Status: ✅ Passed / ❌ Failed / 🚧 Not implemented
  - Notes: [Any details, errors, or suggestions]

- **FEAT_xx: [Feature name]**
  - Status:
  - Notes:

---

# Comparison with last iteration ([Previous Date])
- **FEAT_xx** – [e.g., “Still passing, no regressions”]
- **FEAT_xx** – [e.g., “Now fixed, previously failed due to X”]
- **FEAT_xx** – [e.g., “Still failing, same issue persists”]
- **FEAT_xx** – [e.g., “Newly tested feature, no prior record”]

```

- This replaces the old “per-feature test file + consolidated notes” system. This reduces redundancy in re-documenting functional tests from previous test iterations.
- Documentations before this change are still valid, though. Only the format and rulesets were changed.

## CONSOLIDATED LATEST REPORTS (AS OF SEPTEMBER 13, 2025)

_All contents in this section are the consolidated TLDRs from each test categories. This will be updated for every test iterations_

### MOBILE TESTS IN LIST FORMAT

[**AUTH**](./mobile/auth/sept-13-2025.md)

- ✅ A001: Login – Functional; password peek option for password field suggested for better UX.
- ✅ A002: Signup – Functional; password peek option for password field suggested for better UX.
- ✅ A003: Reset Password – Functional; sends email service properly.
- ✅ A004: Logout – Functional, works as expected.
- ❌ A005: Forgot Password – Not implemented; no reset mechanism available on mobile.

[**FLASHCARDS**](./mobile/flashcards/sept-13-2025.md)

- 🚧 FL001: Create a flashcard set manually – Functional but confusing UX (long press vs tap); cannot fully edit or delete individual cards.
- ✅ FL002: View a flashcard set – Viewing works as expected, no issues.
- ❌ FL003: Edit/update a flashcard set – Failed, can only add cards; editing/deleting not supported.
- ✅ FL004: Delete a flashcard set – Passed, deletion works (accessed via long press).
- ✅ FL005: Change flashcard set visibility – Passed, visibility change is porperly functional.
- ⚠️ FL006: Generate a flashcard set from note – Passed with minor issues; card preview click triggers Call Stack error.
- ⚠️ FL007: Generate a flashcard set from PDF – Passed with minor issues; same Call Stack error as FL006.

[**FORUMS**](./mobile/forums/sept-3-2025.md)

- ✅ FO001: Read/view forum posts – Functional, no regressions.
- ✅ FO002: Search post on forums – Passed, new categories added (newest, top upvotes, most comments).
- ✅ FO003: Create a post – Passed, remained functional.
- ⚠️ FO004: Post attachments – Passed with minor UX issue (inconsistent selection indicator).
- ⚠️ FO005: Edit/update a post – Partially passed; edits apply but with delay.
- ✅ FO006: Delete a post – Passed, fully functional.
- ⚠️ FO007: Upvote/downvote a post – Partially passed; works in feed view but buggy in full post view.
- ✅ FO008: Comment on a post – Passed, remained functional.

- ✅ FO010: Upvote/downvote a comment – Passed, no regressions.
- ✅ FO011: Edit a comment – Passed, remained functional.
- ⚠️ FO012: Notifications – Passed, but UI improvements suggested (add clearer titles/phrases).

[**NAVIGATION**](./mobile/navigation/sept-13-2025.md)

- ❌ NAV001: Navigation after login – Pressing the system back button after first-time login returns the user to the login screen instead of exiting the app. Exit should require double-press for better UX.
- ❌ NAV002: Drawer navigation – Navigation between modules retains states, but back navigation from a shared note in forums incorrectly redirects to the Notes screen.
- ✅ NAV003: Topside tab navigation – Switching between tabs (All, By Recent, AI-generated) works correctly without state loss.
- 🚧 NAV004: Deep linking – Not yet implemented in the app; currently only works in the web platform.
- ✅ NAV005: Logout navigation flow – Logging out redirects to the login screen and prevents back navigation to authenticated routes.
- ❌ NAV006: Error/fallback navigation – Deleted or null items (e.g., shared notes) trigger call stack errors instead of showing an error screen. Shared deletions should dynamically update in forum attachments.
- ✅ NAV007: Automatic login for saved session – Automatically logs in saved sessions but currently directs to the user profile screen; should redirect to the forums screen.

[**NOTES**](./mobile/notes/sept-3-2025.md)

[**POMODORO**](./mobile/pomodoro/sept-3-2025.md)

- ⚠️ PT001: Customize time intervals – Buggy. Save button doesn’t always apply changes.
- ✅ PT002: Drawer display toggle – Works properly, no issues.
- ✅ PT003: Full timer display – Works properly, no issues.
