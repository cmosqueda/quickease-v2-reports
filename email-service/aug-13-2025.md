This contains all test reports for the `email service` modules, tested on August 13, 2025.

**TLDR:**

- **ES004** â€“ Request Email Change Verification: Initially failed (401 error) when clicking "verify email" button due to authentication requirement.
- **ES004 Update**: Verification succeeded when the account was logged in prior to requesting verification; process works as intended in that case.

---

# CODE: ES004

- **DESCRIPTION:** The email template for "Request email change" button found on both the account settings (user side) or manually sent by the admin should take the user to the "auth verify email" screen. The screen should display the account email, along with the associated token, and a "verify email" button. Clicking the "verify email" button should verify the email and navigate user back to the login page.
- **STATUS:** FAILED
- **ERROR ENCOUNTERED:** Code 401. Cannot verify account.
- **FEEDBACK/SUGGESTIONS:** The email service successfully takes the user to the verification page process, but the verify button fails to verify the account, prompting a code 401 on the network.

- **NETWORK TAB RESULTS:**
  - **ACTION PERFORMED:** clicked the `verify` button on the verification page process.
  - **RESULTS:**
  ```
  name: verify-email
  status: 401

## UPDATE

- **DESCRIPTION:** The email template for "Request email change" button found on both the account settings (user side) or manually sent by the admin should take the user to the "auth verify email" screen. The screen should display the account email, along with the associated token, and a "verify email" button. Clicking the "verify email" button should verify the email and navigate user back to the login page.
- **STATUS:** 200
- **ERROR ENCOUNTERED:** N/A
- **FEEDBACK/SUGGESTIONS:** The verification process was successful after I logged in the account I requested verification for. It seems that the verification will only be processed if the account is logged in prior to requesting verification.
