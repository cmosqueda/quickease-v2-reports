**TLDR:**

- Viewing all posts and infinite scroll functions properly for feature **LF021**, but ther is a cutoff date limit for how many posts can be fetched by the state management.

---

# CODE: LF021

- **DESCRIPTION:** User(s) can view all posts in forums and can load more posts when user scrolls down. This means posts that are asynchronously fetched should load infinitely, creating an infinite scroll design.
- **STATUS:** PASSED
- **ERROR ENCOUNTERED:** N/A
- **FEEDBACK/SUGGESTIONS:** Viewing posts and scrolling down infinitely functions as expected. Something to note: there is a cutoff date limit (if post is 1 week older) so if you're trying to scroll down to the much older posts, it will not be fetched or displayed.
