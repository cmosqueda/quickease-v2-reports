Tests for all `forum` functionalities run on August 3, 2025

**TLDR:**

✅ Users can create, edit, and delete posts successfully.

✅ Users can attach notes and flashcards to posts. (Quiz attachment pending visibility feature.)

✅ Voting (upvote/downvote) on posts and comments works as expected.

✅ Commenting and threaded replies function properly.

✅ Users can report posts and comments — however, users can currently report their own comments, which should be restricted.

✅ Search and filter features (by newest, top votes, comments) work smoothly.

⚠️ Categorization by tags is not yet implemented, but partially handled via search.
