## CODE: AD011

- **DESCRIPTION:** On the Other Options, admin can delete user's account (RISKY, please do it with caution.). Upon deletion, a status that stated "Resolved" should appear on the card interface.
- **STATUS:** FAILED
- **ERROR ENCOUNTERED:** Stat code `404`. Cannot delete user account, please look into the backend integration for this.
- **FEEDBACK/SUGGESTIONS:** This is by far the riskiest action for admin-side management. If implemented, Please add a confirmation modal like "Delete user account - Are you sure? This action cannot be undone. Please proceed with caution.", then below are two buttons "Cancel" and "Proceed Deletion". Please also consider implementing this on the user account management, on the similar action `Delete user account`.
