**FEATURE SUGGESTION FOR REPORT MANAGEMENT:**

On handling reports, it is also (sort of) important to be able to log the reports once it is resolved by the admin.

With this, I am proposing for a creation of another `screen` component that displays the logs of all resolved reports. The reason for this is it could be a valuable asset or feature to have in the long run, since logging all resolved reports enables us to generate a dataset that can potentially be used for moderation (or even automating moderation tasks), given that, currently, our first base of content filtering is supported by Gemini (which hypothetically and logically uses up more tokens for each post/comment).

Also, in viewing the full report details, in the actions inside `other options`, I also recommend to have a `scale` or some sort of rating mechanism to rate the severity of the report. If this is implemented, this must be a made a `required input` before proceeding with resolving the report.

Lastly, a `resolve` button should be also added at the bottom-most part of the screen. Clicking this button means that the admin has already resolved the issue, which also should automatically add the record of the report ( (1) the content and the (2) date of report, (3) and the severity rating to the resolved logs

**WORKFLOW:**

1. **REPORT IS PASSED TO ADMIN:** Admin receives a report of a forum post. The report is added in `report management` screen.
2. **VIEWING REPORT:** Admin views the report. The reason(s) for reporting the specific post is/are analyzed thoroughly to decide what to do with the report.
3. **RATING REPORT SEVERITY:** The admin **must rate** the severity of the offense before moving on to next steps or actions to be done.
4. **TAKING ACTION OF THE REPORT:** After rating, the admin must take action on what to do with the report, whether to

   - Delete the reported post/comment, or
   - Delete the violator's account (RISKY)

   Upon taking action, a pop-up toast should display to notify the admin that the action has been done.

5. **RESOLVING REPORT:** After taking action, the admin can now resolve the report. Doing so will record the report into the resolved logs, which can serve as a future dataset intended for using it in moderation tasks.

**POSSIBLE TABLE (diko sure pero mao rani ako ka envision lol, basta kay ma record lang gyud ang report then maka generate tag dataset):**

Resolved_reports_logs:

- resolved_report_id (PK)
- report_id (FK, points to the report record)
- severity_level (low, moderate, high ??? or scale of 1-3 ???? basta)
