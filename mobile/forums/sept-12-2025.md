# What was tested

- **FO002: Search post on forums**

  - Status: ✅ Passed
  - Notes: Improvements are implemented by categorizing "newest", "top upvotes", "most comments"

- **FO004: Post attachments**

  - Status: ⚠️ Passed with minor UX improvement
  - Notes: Selection indicator is not consistent across all three attachments (flashcards, quizzes, notes). Notes employs the "check mark" indicator, while both quizzes and flashcards uses the "border" indicator. Please change the notes attachment selection to "border" indicator. This interface is more visible than the small check mark.

- **FO005: Edit/update a post**

  - Status: ⚠️ Partial passed
  - Notes: Editing for title and captions (rich text) is funtional. But rich text takes a bit of time for the new, updated state to apply.

- **FO006: Delete a post**

  - Status: ✅ Passed
  - Notes: Delete post function is now implemented in the current iteration and works well.

- **FO007: Upvote/downvote a post**

  - Status: ⚠️ Partially passed
  - Notes: Votes are functional at the forum feed level view. However, clicking "upvote" inside the "full post" view downvotes the post.

- **FO009: Threaded replies on comments**

  - Status: ⚠️ Passed with UX fixes required
  - Notes: Comment field is hidden by the keyboard and does not "elevate", please fix to improve UX value.

- **FO012: Notifications**

  - Status: ⚠️ Passed with UI improvements
  - Notes: Functions in real time. Suggestions on the "notifications" interface: Add a title or distinct word/phrase related to the notification for better traceability, example: "Don Joe commented on your post "GNS" "
