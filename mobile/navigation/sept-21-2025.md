ALL TESTS FOR NAVIGATION ON **SEPTEMBER 21, 2025**

TLDR:

- ❌ NAV001: Navigation after login – Failed; back button still returns user to login instead of exiting app. UX fix required (double back press to exit).
- ❌ NAV002: Drawer navigation – Failed; buggy navigation when accessing shared attachments from forum posts.
- ✅ NAV003: Topside tab navigation (Flashcards/Notes/Quizzes) – Passed; no regressions.
- 🚧 NAV004: Deep linking – Not yet implemented; only available on web.
- ✅ NAV005: Logout navigation flow – Passed; remains functional and restricts return to authenticated routes.
- ❌ NAV006: Error/fallback navigation – Failed; no fallback screen for deleted/null shared attachments, app crashes.
- ✅⚠️ NAV007: Automatic login for saved session – Passed with minor fix; redirects to profile screen instead of forums.

# What was tested

- **NAV001: Navigation after login**

  - Status: ❌ Failed
  - Notes: After a successful first-time login, pressing the system back button currently returns the user to the login screen, which is not the expected behavior. Instead, pressing the back button should exit the app. For better UX, exiting the app should require the user to press the back button twice.

- **NAV002: Drawer navigation**

  - Status: ❌ Failed
  - Notes:
    - Drawer navigation is buggy.
    - Issue: navigating from a forum post with shared attachments → opening a shared note → pressing the app’s back navigation directs the user to the Notes screen, which is unexpected behavior. It should take user back to the post screen where the shared attachment is accessed first.

- **NAV003: Topside tab navigation (Flashcards/Notes/Quizzes)**

  - Status: ✅ Passed
  - Notes: Functional

- **NAV004: Deep linking**

  - Status: 🚧 Not yet implemented
  - Notes: Only available in web platform. If I entered a link in my browser, the browser directs me to the web platform and not in the app.

- **NAV005: Logout navigation flow**

  - Status: ✅ Passed
  - Notes: Functions properly. It restricts user from going back to authenticated routes when back button is pressed.

- **NAV006: Error/fallback navigation**

  - Status: ❌ Failed
  - Notes:

    - SCENARIO: I tried navigating on a deleted "shared" note in forum but app crashes/force closes

      Please create an error/fallback screen for "deleted" or null interfaces. If possible, when an item is deleted in the library, its shared attachment in the forums should dynamically reflect that deletion. For example, if I delete a "shared note" from my library, the deletion should also be reflected in the forum post it was attached to.

- **NAV007: Automatic login for saved session**
  - Status: ✅⚠️ Passed with minor fix required
  - Notes: Saved session automatically logs in my account. It directs me to my user profile screen though. It should direct to the forums screen.
