ALL TESTS FOR NAVIGATION ON **SEPTEMBER 13, 2025t**

TLDR:

- ‚ùå NAV001: Navigation after login ‚Äì Pressing the system back button after first-time login returns the user to the login screen instead of exiting the app. Exit should require double-press for better UX.
- ‚ùå NAV002: Drawer navigation ‚Äì Navigation between modules retains states, but back navigation from a shared note in forums incorrectly redirects to the Notes screen.
- ‚úÖ NAV003: Topside tab navigation ‚Äì Switching between tabs (All, By Recent, AI-generated) works correctly without state loss.
- üöß NAV004: Deep linking ‚Äì Not yet implemented in the app; currently only works in the web platform.
- ‚úÖ NAV005: Logout navigation flow ‚Äì Logging out redirects to the login screen and prevents back navigation to authenticated routes.
- ‚ùå NAV006: Error/fallback navigation ‚Äì Deleted or null items (e.g., shared notes) trigger call stack errors instead of showing an error screen. Shared deletions should dynamically update in forum attachments.
- ‚úÖ NAV007: Automatic login for saved session ‚Äì Automatically logs in saved sessions but currently directs to the user profile screen; should redirect to the forums screen.

# What was tested

- **NAV001: Navigation after login**

  - Status: ‚ùå Failed
  - Notes: After a successful first-time login, pressing the system back button currently returns the user to the login screen, which is not the expected behavior. Instead, pressing the back button should exit the app. For better UX, exiting the app should require the user to press the back button twice.

- **NAV002: Drawer navigation**

  - Status: ‚ùå Failed
  - Notes: Drawer navigation is buggy. While navigating between library modules correctly retains their previous states, there is an issue in this scenario: navigating from a forum post with shared attachments ‚Üí opening a shared note ‚Üí pressing the app‚Äôs back navigation directs the user to the Notes screen, which is unexpected behavior.

- **NAV003: Topside tab navigation (Flashcards/Notes/Quizzes)**

  - Status: ‚úÖ Passed
  - Notes: [Details about behavior or issues]

- **NAV004: Deep linking**

  - Status: üöß Not yet implemented
  - Notes: Only available in web platform. If I entered a link in my browser, the browser directs me to the web platform and not in the app.

- **NAV005: Logout navigation flow**

  - Status: ‚úÖ Passed
  - Notes: Functions properly. It restricts user from going back to authenticated routes when back button is pressed.

- **NAV006: Error/fallback navigation**

  - Status: ‚ùå Failed
  - Notes:

    - SCENARIO 1: I tried navigating on a deleted "shared" note in forum but it displays a call stack error:

      ```
      Uncaught Error: Cannot read property 'id' of null
      ```

      Please create an error/fallback screen for "deleted" or null interfaces. If possible, when an item is deleted in the library, its shared attachment in the forums should dynamically reflect that deletion. For example, if I delete a "shared note" from my library, the deletion should also be reflected in the forum post it was attached to.

- **NAV007: Automatic login for saved session**
  - Status: ‚úÖ Passed with minor fix required
  - Notes: Saved session automatically logs in my account. It directs me to my user profile screen though. It should direct to the forums screen.
