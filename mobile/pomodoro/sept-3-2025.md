ALL TESTS FOR POMODORO ON **SEPTEMBER 3, 2025**

**TLDR:**

- ‚úÖ Pomodoro drawer toggle works as expected.
- ‚ùå Customizing time intervals and accessing full timer display both fail due to a rendering issue (`Invalid RGBA format` error). Navigation and editing are blocked.
- üõ†Ô∏è Root cause appears to be a UI rendering bug affecting multiple modules. Needs urgent fix to restore full Pomodoro functionality.
