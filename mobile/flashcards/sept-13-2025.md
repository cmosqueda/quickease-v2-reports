# What was tested

- **FL001: Create a flashcard set manually**

  - Status: üöß Partially Passed ( Issue + Improvements)
  - Notes: Creation is functional. However, the floating button for flashcard creation (choose between manual or generate) needs to be "long pressed". But manual creation can be accessed by with a tap of the floating button though. This causes confusion for users. If possible, replace "long press" with "one tap" and explicitly allow the user choose between "manual creation" or "generate". Also, during creation, I cannot totally "edit" each of these card's content (like editing the front and back contents, or delete a card). Creation is only for "adding" new cards.

- **FL003: Edit/update a flashcard set**

  - Status: ‚ùå Failed
  - Notes: Can only add new cards in a flashcard set, not edit or delete specific cards.

- **FL004: Delete a flashcard set**

  - Status: ‚úÖ Passed
  - Notes: Deleting a flashcard set is functional. Option to delete is accessed through "long press". This needs to be properly documented in the user manual for clarity.

- **FL005: Change a flashcard set visibility**

  - Status: ‚úÖ Passed
  - Notes: Visbility change is properly working; tried accessing a shared flashcard with changed visibility and its changed visbility state was applied properly. However, it takes ave. delay of 4 seconds to load the changes.

- **FL006: Generate a flashcard set from note**

  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Passed with minor issues
  - Notes: Generation is functional, but clicking card previews triggers a Call Stack error:
    ```
    Uncaught Error: setFlipped is not a function (it is undefined)
    ```

- **FL007: Generate a flashcard set from PDF**
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Passed with minor issues
  - Notes: Same issue as FL006. Generation is functional, but clicking card previews triggers a Call Stack error:
    ```
    Uncaught Error: setFlipped is not a function (it is undefined)
    ```
