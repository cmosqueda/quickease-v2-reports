# What was tested

- **FL001: Create a flashcard set manually**

  - Status: ✅⚠️ Passed but another issue detected
  - Notes:
    - ✅ Updates on this test: Suggestions and fixes from last test are implemented. Floating button now allows user to choose between manual or generate in one tap. Can also perform CRUD operations on the cards' contents. Card previews are also seamless.
    - ⚠️ Issue detected: For empty flashcard set state (like a scenario where flashcards are not yet created on the flashcard library), it does not allow creation because the "floating create button" is hidden, invisible. The screen only displays the "No flashcards yet" fallback screen, with the search icon on top.

- **FL003: Edit/update a flashcard set**

  - Status: ❌ Failed
  - Notes: Can only ADD new cards in a flashcard set, not edit or delete existing cards' contents.

- **FL005: Change a flashcard set visibility**

  - Status: ❌ Failed
  - Notes: Change flashcard visibility is functional but other users can still access "private" flashcards.

- **FL006: Generate a flashcard set from note**

  - Status: ✅ Passed, fixes from last test now added
  - Notes: Generation is functional, card previews issue from last test now fixed.

- **FL007: Generate a flashcard set from PDF**

  - Status: ✅ Passed, fixes from last test now added
  - Notes: Generation is functional, card previews issue from last test now fixed.
