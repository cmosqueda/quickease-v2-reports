Tests for functionalities related to `ai generation` tested on August 3, 2025

**TLDR:**

✅ Note Generation from Document works with minor delay; suggestion: add a loading indicator and success toast.

- update: ⚠️ (Tilan) Document-based summary generation (AI002)FAILED — Summary note generation from uploaded documents produces blank output.

✅ (update) Note Generation from image now works properly

✅ Flashcard Generation from Notes & Documents works properly; some delay noted but acceptable.

✅ Quiz Generation from Notes & Documents works accurately; generation is slightly faster than other AI processes.

⚠️ General Suggestion: Add visual feedback (e.g., loading screen or toast) during and after generation for better user experience.

# Generate Note

## CODE: AI002

- **DESCRIPTION:** User can generate summary note from uploaded document
- **STATUS:** PASSED
- **ERROR ENCOUNTERED:** N/A
- **FEEDBACK/SUGGESTIONS:**
  - Mosqueda: A noticeable delay during generation process but it's bearable. I suggest having a fallback, like a loading screen or something to hint users that they're anticipating for an event to happen. Also, on the creation, I suggest putting a popup toast to inform user of the successsful creation.
  - Tilan (new test update): Summary note generation from uploaded documents is not working.

- **DESCRIPTION:** User can generate summary note from uploaded image
- **STATUS:** PASSED
- **ERROR ENCOUNTERED:** N/A
- **FEEDBACK/SUGGESTIONS:** Note generation from image is wokring as expected. I suggest to add a loading screen or indicator during the generation process to let the user know that's in progress. Also, a toast notification confirming that the note has been saved would improve feedback and overall user experience.
