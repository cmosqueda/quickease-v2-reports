# What was tested

- **Q003: Review a quiz**

  - Status: ⚠️ Passed with refinements needed
  - Notes:
    - Core functionality works (reviewing attempts, answers, and correct answers displays properly).
    - ❗UI issue: On mobile responsive screen size, the "donut percentage" visualization overlaps outside the container.
    - Suggestion: Apply responsive container constraints or auto-scale chart for smaller screens.

- **Q011: Share a quiz via URL copy**
  - Status: 🚧 Not yet implemented
  - Notes: N/A
