# What was tested

**FO003: Create a post**

- Status: ❌ Failed in mobile screen size
- Notes:

- Notes: Notifications for reports resolved by admin to user not yet implemented.

**FO013: Report a post/comment**

- Status: ✅⚠️ Passed with refinement needed
- Notes:

  - ⚠️ Issue: Reported comments do not reflect on the ADMIN’s report management tab.

- Status: ✅ Passed
- Notes:
  - Share button copies the post URL successfully.
  - URL opens correctly when accessed via browser/external apps.
